Apply for this financial aid, even if you don’t think you will qualify, because it shows the hospital that you are trying to find ways to pay and work with them.\n\nAsk for your account to be placed on hold while your application is being processed. This is common practice, but make sure you ask that this is done just in case.",
    "Ask the hospital if you can enroll in a payment plan. This will allow you to pay off your bill in small amounts over an extended period of time. If you do this and you try your best to pay small amounts toward your bill whenever you can, after a while you may be able to renegotiate the amount of your bill. Explain that you are concerned you will not be able to pay the current amount, and that a smaller amount would be more manageable for your situation.\n\nA medical billing expert we spoke with about this situation and assures patients that negotiating bills is common practice for hospitals, and some hospitals may be even more willing to give patients renegotiations at the end of the year, when they want to close billing accounts in preparation for the new year.",
