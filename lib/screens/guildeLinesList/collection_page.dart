Here is a template Failure to Validate letter: https://038b81d3-e365-410b-aae4-6abfa16bcab5.filesusr.com/ugd/ecc7c0_0178390f990542608eec0c82640cb513.pdf" +

You never signed any agreement authorizing them to access your medical records, so if they obtain this information, they have violated your privacy rights under HIPAA. At this point, you have the option to sue them if you wish, but at the very least, they must remove the debt and cease collection of the debt if they have violated your HIPAA rights.

    "After you have disputed your bill, if you were not able to get the debt removed, set up a payment plan with the collection agency so that you can pay small amounts toward your bill over time. After you have paid a bit of the bill off, you will be on good terms with the agency, and you should ask have your debt lowered/negotiated to an amount that you can afford.",
    "It may seem counterintuitive, but AARP recommends that you prioritize paying off other types of debt, such as car loans, credit card bills etc. before paying off your medical debt. This is because medical debt is less damaging to your credit score than other types of debt.",
    "The AARP warns patients not to trade medical debt for other types of debt; i.e. do not take out a loan to pay off your debt, or pay off your medical bills with a credit card. This is because medical debt typically does not have late fees or interest associated with it, while other forms of debt do. Medical debt also takes longer to appear on your credit report than other forms of debt, giving you more time to take care of it.",
